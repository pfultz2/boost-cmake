# TODO



# A bug in the Win32 intel compilers causes compilation of one of our
# tests to take forever when debug symbols are enabled. This rule
# turns them off when added to the requirements section









# Turn off this test on HP CXX, as the test hangs when executing.
# Whenever the cause for the failure of the polymorphism test is found
# and fixed, this should be retested.
