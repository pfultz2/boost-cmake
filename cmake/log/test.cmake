# Disable warnings about using 'insecure' standard C functions


# Disable Intel warnings:
# warning #177: function "X" was declared but never referenced
# warning #780: using-declaration ignored -- it refers to the current namespace
# warning #2196: routine is both "inline" and "noinline"
# remark #1782: #pragma once is obsolete. Use #ifndef guard instead.
# remark #193: zero used for undefined preprocessing identifier "X"
# remark #304: access control not specified ("public" by default)
# remark #981: operands are evaluated in unspecified order
# remark #1418: external function definition with no prior declaration
# Mostly comes from Boost.Phoenix: warning #411: class "X" defines no constructor to initialize the following: reference member "Y"...
# warning #734: "X" (declared at line N of "file.hpp"), required for copy that was eliminated, is inaccessible
# warning #279: controlling expression is constant



# Testers typically don't specify threading environment and the library can be built and tested for single and multi. I'm more interested in multi though.

# this rule enumerates through all the sources and invokes
# the run rule for each source, the result is a list of all
